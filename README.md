# TransitionManager


First implementation of Transition Manager for iOS. I feel a little architectural affection on Android fragment system, so I decided to realise my own lightweight manager, using only container view and UIViewController for basic view.

This is my first commit, so the version is unnamed still.

# What to do

Give an examples
Add transition support
Implement search by object in fragment stack
